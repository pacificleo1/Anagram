# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Project:** Web-Based Anagram Generator  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 2023

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose  
This document outlines the requirements and guidelines for a web‑based anagram generator application. The service allows any user with an internet connection to visit a URL, enter their name and text for which anagrams are to be generated, and view the results. The goal is to produce a playful yet robust application that adheres to best development practices while ensuring a seamless user experience.

### 1.2 Scope  
- **Frontend:**  
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React if more complex state management is required) will be used to design the user interface.
  - The homepage must allow users to input their name and other parameters with in‑built validations as per provided guidelines.
  - Following the input, users can generate anagrams via a “Generate” button.
  - A “Reset” button allows users to clear inputs and return to the initial state.

- **Backend:**  
  - Developed in Python using FastAPI.
  - The server will implement the anagram generation logic.
  - Endpoints will be used for input validation, anagram generation, and error handling.
  
- **Deployment:**  
  - Using platforms such as Vercel (for static frontend serving), Render (for the backend API), and GitHub for version control.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Input:  
- **Name Input Field:**  
  - **Validation Rules:**  
    - Must be at least 1 word.
    - Each word must be **at least 3 characters long**.
    - Can contain at most **10 words**, with each word having a maximum of **10 characters**.
  - **Error Handling:**  
    - If a user enters an invalid name, display a clear, inline error message (see Section 4.3) and disable the “Generate” button.
    
- **Other User Input Fields:**  
  - Additional fields (e.g., text for which anagrams need to be generated) will be present below the name. The design should match the visual style shown in the provided screenshot images.
  - Appropriate validations should be performed to ensure inputs are correct before enabling the “Generate” button.

### 2.2 Button Actions:  
- **Generate Button:**  
  - Initially disabled until all validations on the input fields pass.
  - On clicking the generate button, the frontend should:
    1. Validate the user inputs.
    2. Call the backend API to generate anagrams.
    3. Display a new page where the generated anagrams are listed at the top.
    
- **Reset Button:**  
  - When clicked, resets all input fields and navigates back to the home page with the original layout as defined in the first screenshot.

### 2.3 Anagram Generation Logic:  
- **Server‑Side Processing:**  
  - The logic for generating anagrams must reside on the server.
  - The algorithm can a) rearrange letters or b) rearrange words based on input.  
    - **Note:** If generating all possible anagrams for larger texts, consider performance implications; you may use heuristics or carry out random sampling if necessary.
  - The backend will expose an API (e.g., `POST /generate-anagram`) to process requests and return the resulting anagrams.
  
### 2.4 Page Flow  
- **Homepage:**  
  - Contains text inputs, error message placeholders, and the two buttons (Generate and Reset).
  
- **Results Page:**  
  - Displays the generated anagrams in a list or grid view.
  - Contains a “Reset” button to allow users to start over.
  
- **Reset Action:**  
  - Clears all user entries and returns to the original home page layout.

## 3. Non‑Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance  
- The application must deliver quick feedback for input validations.
- The anagram generation API should respond within a few seconds for typical input lengths.

### 3.2 Scalability  
- The system should enable horizontal scaling on the backend (using Render/FastAPI deployment best practices).
- Ensure frontend assets are optimized for quick load times.

### 3.3 Usability & Accessibility  
- The UI design must be intuitive, following usability best practices:
  - **Typography:** Clear, legible fonts.
  - **Color Scheme:**  
    - Primary action buttons (Generate, Reset) should use a distinctive, accessible color (e.g., a deep blue or green).
    - The background can be a clean, neutral color (e.g., white or light grey) for contrast.
  - **Responsiveness:**  
    - UI components should be mobile-friendly and adapt to different screen sizes.
- Accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA roles, semantic HTML) must be followed to support assistive technologies.

### 3.4 Security  
- **Input Sanitization:** All inputs must be sanitized on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks.
- **Usage Limits:** If the anagram generation logic is computationally heavy, consider defensive measures like rate limiting.

### 3.5 Reliability & Maintainability  
- The server should have proper error logging.
- Follow best practices with modular code design (both frontend and backend).
- Use automated testing (unit tests for critical functions and integration tests for API endpoints).

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 Frontend Framework and Structure  
- **Technologies:**  
  - Use HTML for structure.
  - CSS (or a CSS framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap if needed) for styling.
  - JavaScript for state management and AJAX requests (or React if more advanced state management is desired).
  
- **State Management:**  
  - Basic JavaScript state management or React hooks if using React.
  
- **Layout:**  
  - The homepage layout should closely mimic the provided design screenshots (e.g., positioning of text boxes, buttons, error messages).
  
- **Folder Structure:**  
  - The frontend should be organized into clear components or sections to segregate layout files, style files, and JavaScript logic.

### 4.2 Backend (FastAPI)  
- **Technologies:**  
  - Python with FastAPI for rapid API development.
  - Use asynchronous processing where required.
  
- **Endpoints:**  
  - `POST /generate-anagram`: Receives JSON payload with user inputs; returns a list of generated anagrams.
  - `GET /health`: A simple endpoint to monitor the status of the service.
  
- **Implementation Guidelines:**  
  - Write unit tests for the anagram generation logic.
  - Document endpoints with FastAPI’s automatic docs (Swagger UI).
  - Use Pydantic for data validation in request models.

### 4.3 Error Handling & Messages  
- **Frontend Error Messaging:**  
  - For input errors, display messages inline (e.g., right below or adjacent to the text field).
  - Example error message for the name input:  
    _"Please enter a valid name. Each word must be at least 3 characters long and no more than 10 characters per word. You can enter a maximum of 10 words."_
  
- **Backend Error Handling:**  
  - Return HTTP 400 for invalid inputs with descriptive error messages.
  - On unhandled server errors, return a generic message such as:  
    _"Oops, something went wrong. Please try again later."_

### 4.4 UX/UI Guidelines and Color Choices  
- **General Aesthetic:**  
  - Follow a modern, minimalistic design.
  - Use plenty of white space, clear typography, and easily identifiable call-to-action buttons.
  
- **Color Palette (Example):**  
  - **Primary Color:** Deep Blue or Green (for buttons and highlights).  
  - **Secondary Color:** Lighter shades of the primary color for hover states.
  - **Background:** Light grey or white for clarity and contrast.
  - **Error Notifications:** Use red or orange tones to differentiate validation messages.
  
- **Interaction Guidelines:**  
  - Provide immediate feedback when validations fail.
  - Animate button states (hover, active) for a smoother interactive experience.
  - Clearly indicate focus states for form inputs to aid keyboard navigation.

### 4.5 Code Quality and Deployment Considerations  
- **General Guidelines:**  
  - Write clean, maintainable code with proper documentation.
  - Use comments and docstrings to explain non‑trivial logic, especially the anagram generation algorithm.
  - Structure the code in modules and components to ease future maintenance.
  
- **Version Control and CI/CD:**  
  - Use GitHub for version control.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines to run automated tests on every commit.
  
- **Deployment:**  
  - Frontend hosted on Vercel (or similar static hosting).
  - Backend deployed via Render or a similar platform that supports FastAPI.
  - Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., API keys, debug mode) in both local and production environments.
  
- **Monitoring and Logging:**  
  - Implement logging on the backend to capture errors, input validation failures, and performance metrics.
  - Set up health check endpoints and application performance monitoring (APM) for post-deployment tracking.

## 5. API Design (Example)

Below is a quick sketch of how the API endpoints might be structured:

- **Endpoint:** `POST /generate-anagram`
  - **Request Body Example:**  
    ```json
    {
      "user_name": "John Doe",
      "input_text": "example"
    }
    ```
  - **Response Example:**  
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "anagrams": ["elpmaxe", "xemplea", "..."]
    }
    ```

- **Endpoint:** `GET /health`
  - **Response:**  
    ```json
    {
      "status": "ok"
    }
    ```
